# Ghost S3 Storage Adapter

**Minimum required Ghost version: 0.10.0**

This module allows you to read and write images from Amazon S3 instead of
storing them locally.

After installing, new images that you save will use an absolute URL to S3. Any
requests to `/content/images/` will be proxied to S3, so that any previous
images in your blog will not be affected.

## Installation

You will need to have a the custom storage module directly in your project
directory, the easiest way to do this is:

```bash
$ npm install ghost-s3-storage-adapter
$ mkdir content/storage
$ cp -r node_modules/ghost-s3-storage-adapter content/storage/ghost-s3
```

Alternative method is to use the node module and create an index.js file with
folder path 'content/storage/ghost-s3/index.js' (manually create folder if not exist)

```javascript
'use strict';
module.exports = require('ghost-s3-storage-adapter');
```


## Configuration

Create new IAM User with permissions to get object from that bucket. Save the
`ACCESS_KEY` and `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`.

In `config.js`, add a `storage` block for each environment.

```javascript
    storage: {
        active: 'ghost-s3',
        'ghost-s3': {
            accessKeyId: 'Put_your_access_key_here',
            secretAccessKey: 'Put_your_secret_key_here',
            bucket: 'Put_your_bucket_name_here',
            region: 'Put_your_bucket_region_here'
        }
    },
```


### Asset host

You can add `assetHost` to your config to specify a virtual host url. This is
most frequently used with a content delivery network (CDN) such as CloudFront,
CloudFlare, or others. The modified `storage` block would be:

```javascript
    storage: {
        active: 'ghost-s3',
        'ghost-s3': {
            accessKeyId: 'ACCESS_KEY',
            secretAccessKey: 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
            bucket: 'S3_BUCKET_NAME',
            region: 'S3_REGION',
            assetHost: 'https://cdn.yourdomain.com/'
        }
    }
```

You can add `assetHost` to your config to specify a virtual host url. For more
